# GUI_Maze-Solver-A-star-PathFinding-Algorithm
I used the A* Path Finding Algorithm and pygame to build this GUI maze solver! You can create your own custom maze by adding start/end point and barriers.

## Controls
- ESC - To reset the board
- SPACE - To begin the solve
- LEFT CLICK - First two left clicks place the start and end point, and the rest of the left clicks place barriers
- RIGHT CLICK - To erase
